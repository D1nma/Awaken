Hi, first and foremost thank you very much for buying this package! I really hope it helps you in the development of your current and future projects!

--- Setting up the project ------------------------------------------------------- 
Please read the "First steps" pdf file, section "Setting up the project" (the first one). This is the first thing you need to do. It is mandatory to follow these instructions in order avoid errors. (this section is available in the online documentation as well). 

--- Quick start ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The second section of the "First steps" pdf consist of a basic guide whose main purpose is to help you create a simple character + camera setup (2D and 3D). For a more detailed explanation please go to the online documentation.

--- Online documentation -----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the link to the online documentation

https://lightbug14.gitbook.io/ccp/

The pdf you see in the Documentation folder is valid for 1.0.x. It may or may not contain some differences with the online manual.


Even though this document is valid i'm always working on the online version, so you will get updated content, tutorials, hopefully better explanations, and so on. I would recommend you to use the online version, and of course to update the package.


Since now it's not possible for me to clone the online version into a pdf file, i have to stick with the online version as much as i can. Maintaining both formats (html and pdf) is a tremendous amount of work. Just know that an offline parallel version is what i want (as well as you probably), so i will try to create/maintain both if i figure it out how. If you have any suggestion related to this topic i'm all ears :).
